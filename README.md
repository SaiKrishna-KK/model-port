**Deploy your ML models anywhere** — regardless of architecture or operating system. ModelPort simplifies the process of exporting models to ONNX format and packaging them for deployment on different platforms.

## 📣 Version 1.5 Release 
> *June 2023 - New release with enhanced capabilities and extensive testing*

We're excited to announce **ModelPort 1.5**, our newest release with significant improvements focused on model portability and deployment flexibility! This release adds framework auto-detection, model validation, Docker deployment capabilities, and GPU acceleration support.

This release has undergone extensive testing including:
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality
- ✅ Edge case handling for tiny models, complex models, and mixed data types
- ✅ Stress testing with multiple model outputs and custom dtypes
- ✅ End-to-end validation with ResNet18 and other common architectures

## 🌟 Features

## 📦 Installation

### Using pip (recommended)

```bash
# Install from PyPI (coming soon)
pip install modelport

# Or install directly from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/SaiKrishna-KK/model-port.git
```

### Development Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SaiKrishna-KK/model-port.git
cd model-port

# Create and activate a conda environment
conda env create -f modelport/environment.yml
conda activate modelport_env

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Export a model to ONNX (framework auto-detected)
modelport export path/to/model.pt

# Export with validation
modelport export path/to/model.pt --test

# Customize input shape
modelport export path/to/model.pt --input-shape 1,3,224,224

# Run the exported model on a specific architecture
modelport run my_exported_model --arch linux/arm64

# Deploy to Docker Hub
modelport deploy my_exported_model --tag username/model:latest --push

# Build GPU-accelerated container
modelport deploy my_exported_model --gpu
```

### Python API

```python
import torch
import modelport

# Load your model
model = torch.load("path/to/model.pt") 

# Export to ONNX and package it
export_dir = modelport.export_model(
    "path/to/model.pt", 
    "my_exported_model",
    test=True  # Validate the model
)

# Run the model in Docker
modelport.run_capsule("my_exported_model", "linux/amd64")

# Deploy to Docker Hub
modelport.deploy_capsule(
    "my_exported_model",
    tag="username/model:latest",
    push=True
)
```

## 📄 ModelPort Capsule Format

ModelPort packages models in a standardized format with everything needed to run the model:

```
modelport_capsule/
├── model.onnx             # Model converted to ONNX format
├── inference.py           # Sample inference code
├── config.json            # Input/output metadata
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── capsule_spec.json      # Capsule metadata & version info
├── runtime/
│   ├── Dockerfile.x86_64  # x86_64 Docker container
│   ├── Dockerfile.arm64   # ARM64 Docker container
│   └── Dockerfile.gpu     # GPU-enabled Docker container
```

The `capsule_spec.json` file (new in v1.5) contains structured metadata about the model:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "name": "resnet18",
  "framework": "pytorch",
  "created_at": "2023-06-15T14:32:10.123456",
  "input_shape": [1, 3, 224, 224],
  "input_dtype": "float32",
  "test_results": {
    "success": true,
    "input_shape": [1, 3, 224, 224],
    "output_shapes": [[1, 1000]],
    "timestamp": "2023-06-15T14:32:15.654321"
  },
  "runtime": {
    "supports_gpu": true,
    "supports_cpu": true,
    "supported_platforms": ["linux/amd64", "linux/arm64"]
  },
  "deployment": {
    "image": "modelport/resnet18:latest",
    "platforms": ["linux/amd64", "linux/arm64"],
    "gpu_enabled": true
  }
}
```

## 🐳 Docker Setup

ModelPort uses Docker for cross-platform deployment. Make sure you have Docker installed and properly configured:

```bash
# Make sure Docker is installed
docker --version

# For Apple Silicon (M1/M2) or other architectures, 
# enable multi-architecture builds
modelport/scripts/setup_docker.sh
```

## 🔧 Supported Architectures

### 🔜 Planned for v3.0: Enterprise Features
- **Model Monitoring**: Track performance and detect drift
- **Batch Inference**: Optimized batch processing
- **A/B Testing**: Compare model versions in production
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment

## 📊 Performance

In our benchmarks, ModelPort-exported models achieve performance comparable to native models, with the added benefit of portability:

| Architecture | Image Classification (ms) | Object Detection (ms) |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| x86_64       | 42                        | 156                    |
| arm64        | 58                        | 203                    |
| GPU (CUDA)   | 12                        | 45                     |
