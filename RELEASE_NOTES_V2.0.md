# ModelPort v2.0 Release Notes

We're excited to announce the release of ModelPort v2.0, introducing native compilation capabilities for deploying machine learning models with zero Python dependencies!

## What's New in v2.0

### Native Compilation with TVM

- **Model Compilation**: Compile ONNX models to highly optimized native shared libraries (.so, .dylib)
- **Zero-dependency Execution**: Run models without Python or ONNX Runtime dependencies
- **Cross-architecture Support**: Compile for x86_64, arm64, and aarch64 platforms
- **Device Targeting**: Support for CPU, CUDA, Metal, and OpenCL

### New CLI Commands

- `modelport compile`: Compile ONNX models to native libraries
  ```bash
  modelport compile path/to/model.onnx --target-arch x86_64 --target-device cpu
  ```

- `modelport run-native`: Run inference with compiled models
  ```bash
  modelport run-native modelport_native --benchmark --iterations 100
  ```

### C++ Integration

- Direct inference from C++ applications without Python dependencies
- Example C++ inference code with CMake build configuration
- Cross-platform support for native inference

### Performance Features

- Optimization level control (0-3) for compilation
- Benchmark capabilities for performance testing
- Batch inference with throughput scaling analysis

## Detailed Improvements

### Compiler Module

- Advanced TVM IR-based compilation pipeline
- Architecture and device auto-detection
- Configurable optimization levels
- Test suite with model validation

### Runtime Module

- Fast inference with compiled models
- Benchmarking functionality
- Batch size support
- Custom input shapes

### Documentation

- Comprehensive documentation for native compilation
- C++ integration guide
- New examples

## Testing and Validation

This release includes a comprehensive test suite:

- Unit tests for compiler functionality
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Stress tests with large models, irregular shapes, and error conditions
- C++ integration tests
- Performance benchmarking

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this release. All existing functionality from v1.5 continues to work as before.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- ONNX and ONNX Runtime
- TVM for native compilation (optional)

## Installation

```bash
pip install modelport

# For native compilation features
conda install -c conda-forge tvm
```

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for future updates including:
- WASM compilation for browser deployment
- INT8 and mixed-precision quantization
- Additional hardware target support
