# GitHub Issues for ModelPort v2.0 - Native Compilation

## Core Features

1. **Integrate TVM Compiler into ModelPort**
   - Add Apache TVM as a dependency
   - Create core compilation logic in `core/compiler.py`
   - Implement model conversion from ONNX to TVM IR
   - Generate platform-specific shared libraries

2. **Create CLI Command for Compilation**
   - Implement `modelport compile` command
   - Support target architecture specification
   - Add options for optimization levels
   - Support custom output paths

3. **Implement Test Inference Script**
   - Create lightweight runtime for compiled models
   - Implement dummy input generation
   - Add comparison with original model output
   - Support both Python and C++ inference

4. **Architecture Auto-detection**
   - Detect system architecture automatically
   - Choose appropriate compilation targets
   - Support cross-compilation for different platforms
   - Generate correctly named libraries based on target

5. **CPU/GPU-specific Codegen**
   - Add support for CUDA compilation
   - Add support for Metal compilation (macOS)
   - Support OpenCL for wider GPU compatibility
   - Implement device detection and selection

## Refactoring & Integration

6. **Update Project Structure for v2.0**
   - Refactor directory structure to include compilation
   - Update documentation for new features
   - Ensure backward compatibility with v1.5
   - Add examples for native compilation

7. **Native Capsule Format**
   - Design new capsule format for compiled models
   - Add metadata for compiled artifacts
   - Include platform compatibility information
   - Support versioning for compiled models

8. **Comprehensive Testing Framework**
   - Create unit tests for compilation process
   - Add integration tests for end-to-end workflow
   - Implement performance benchmarks
   - Add comparison with non-compiled models
